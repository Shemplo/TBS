each bond and sorts appropriate variants according to it. **Be careful (disclaimer)**:
_score value is not a ground truth but we try to make it more objective as possible_

### How to use
* Link `üåê` allows to open bonds page in Tinkoff investment
* Link `üîç` allows to inspect known coupons of corresponding bond
* Credit values are calculated with consideration to the inflation with the equation: 
let `S` some sum, let `D` number of a days and `I` is inflation in percents than
`s` value equals to `S / (1 + I)^(D / 365)` is sum that corresponding to `S` in `D` days
* In case of coupon value is unknown then latest known value (or 0.0) will be used with
discount of 0.9 modifier due to this value is not reliable and it's some penalty to final score
* There is no guarantee that prices that are mentioned in table are still the same when
table is shown and used for some time. This value is retrieved one when bond data is requested
from MOEX (before table is shown).
